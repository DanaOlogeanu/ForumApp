Now you can\u2019t decide which is more stunning, the sea or the salvias!   Often referred to as scarlet sage, the red salvia plant is actually part of the mint family! These ruby reds are indigenous to Brazil where, due to its hot climate, they grow as perennials. They are treated as annual plants in a more temperate climate, as they will not survive harsh frosts and frigid weather. "

The moral of the story is if you want to stay young and beautiful, buy yourself a heliconia. And that\u2019s the Gospel Truth (insert shameless Disney plug here). "
